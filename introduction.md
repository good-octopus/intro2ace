# Basic introduction to asexuality 
**what is asexual?**

Let's start from the basics. What does "being asexual" mean? 
Asexuality is defined by lack of sexual attraction. Sexual attraction is the desire to engage in sexual activity with someone. (Please know that I'm not the most qualified person to explain what sexual attraction is.)

There are many forms of attraction and you are still asexual if you experience them. Remember, asexuality is defined by the lack of sexual attraction, not the lack of attraction.
